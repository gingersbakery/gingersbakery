<p align="center">
Hello fellow customers, I am Ginger. I can be mostly found in docks, rps, and fandom spots.
</p>
<p align="center">
  I am free to do ship rps unless I am roleplaying Gourdy, as he is a minor. If you want to ship rp, ask me in whispers! <3
  </p>
 <p align="center">
  I am  free to listen to anything, but I can also talk or yap about anything. Please remember that I don't think first before saying something which can be triggering.
 </p>
<p align="center">
  I am more likely to offtab or afk, all because I am watching tiktok,checking discord, looking at someone's social media to find any boundaries before I interact them, or just working on something
  </p>
<p align="center">
  During rps, specifically dw rps, I usually RP as any character I have if that character is available. Sometimes, I spectate because I am tired or wanted to let someone take the character instead.
</p>
<p align="center">
  I don't mind kisses, boops, but sometimes I move away when I get covered since I like looking at myself.. Dw! I don't mind crowds!
</p>

</p>
<p align="center">
people that support/are fans of any problematic people, media, and fandoms
</p>
<p align="center">
DNI IF YOU'RE GONNA SAY OR DO NSFW ON ME. IM A MINOR. unless ita satire or joke, but still. don't do this... 
</p>
<p align="center">
DNI if you're just gonna be toxic or bully me for being just a DW fan, I know the fandom is crazy rn, but it doesn't mean you have to harass someone...
